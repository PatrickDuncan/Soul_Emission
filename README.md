2D, Atmospheric Sci-fi Shooter/Platformer Made in Unity.

My goal is to have a professional looking/feeling/sounding game on multiple platforms.

What I've attained from creating this project:
- Obtained practical experience with C#.
- Improved OOP skills.
- Learned how to effectively use APIs and it's documentation.
- Exponentially improved my graphics capabilities with GIMP.
