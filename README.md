# Soul_Emission
2-D, Atmospheric Shooter/Platformer Made in Unity.

My goal is to have a professional looking/feeling/sounding game on multiple platforms.

What I've attained from creating this project:
- Got practical experience with C#.
- Improved OOP skills
- Learned how to effectively use an API and it's documents.
- Exponentially improed my graphics capabilities with GIMP.
